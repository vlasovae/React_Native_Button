Created by Elizaveta Vlasova with inspiration from [this React Native tutorial](https://reactnative.dev/docs/tutorial)

## Expo
To run this from your browser, visit the Expo snack available [here](https://snack.expo.io/@vlasovae/react_native_button)

### Explanation

To run this app from the command line, you must have the Expo and React Native CLIs installed, more data is available [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

After all of this is installed and you have cloned this repository, to run the app use

'npm start' or 'expo start'

This will open a window in a browser where you can view the application in the browser or on a simulated phone. There will also be an image of a QR code in the browser window as well as the console. If you scan this with your phone's camera (on iOS) or with the Expo app (on Android), you are able to view the application on your device.

When the application is launched, there is one button on the screen, when it is pressed, a message will appear. If the button is pressed again, the message disappears.
